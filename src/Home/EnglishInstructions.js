            You will need a computer or tablet{" "}
            <span className="redHighlight">connected to the internet</span> in a
            quiet room without distractions.{" "}
            <span className="redHighlight">Google Chrome</span> and{" "}
            <span className="redHighlight">Microsoft Edge</span>
            browsers are recommended for testing on your device. If you are
            using <span className="redHighlight">Safari</span> please see the
            instruction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the device’s audio is set to a{" "}
            <span className="redHighlight">loud</span> volume so your child can
            hear the task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the child sits in a comfortable position and can clearly
            see the screen.

          <li>
            <span className="redHighlight">Do not</span> refresh the browser or
            hit the back button once you have started a task or all progress

            Be sure the child is the one using the mouse or touch screen when
            answering the questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you start a task, please finish it. You don’t have to do both
            the English and Mandarin tasks at once, but it is recommended.

            Some of the sentences will be difficult.{" "}
            <span className="redHighlight">Allow your child to guess</span>
            rather than tell them the answers. This should be a reflection of
            <span className="redHighlight">their knowledge</span>, not yours.

          <li>
            This may be hard for you, but{" "}
            <span className="redHighlight">do not</span> tell your child if the
            answer is correct or incorrect. We{" "}
            <span className="redHighlight">do not</span> expect your child to
            get all the answers right.
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s okay to stay silent, but if you want to show encouragement,
            here are some examples: ‘You did a good job listening!’; ‘Great job
            paying attention!’
          </li>
          <li>
            Each sentence will automatically play{" "}

            between sentences) before progressing to the next sentence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the pause button during the testing if your child needs a break.
